# Description
This is the Etch-a-Sketch project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/etch-a-sketch-project).

The main goals of the project were:
  * Create DOM elements (`div`) using javascript
  * Remove the elements as needed
  * Manipulate the elements by changing their color
  * Practice using HTML buttons with JavaScript

## Notable items
  1. This project came together easier than I was expecting. Possibly because
  I had added and removed elements as needed for the Rock Paper Scissors project.
  2.  Successfully used forEach to change all elements in an array.
  3. First use of a modal in one of my projects. The project description by TOP
  mentioned used a prompt box to get input but I found the prompts annoying. I 
  considered using a slider for resizing input but felt that the modal was more
  inline with the original descriptions. Using a modal also meant I had to do 
  less validation compared to a prompt box since I was able to limit input to 
  numbers and didn't have to worry about the cancel button.
  4. Attempted to organize my javascript code by adding a short description to 
  each function. At the end, I also alphabetized the functions to make it easier 
  to navigate in the future.
  5. Having the grey scale option change color by 10% with each pass was a little
  tricky initally. Using rgb values made it easy to change the color by 10% and 
  I used an array to track the value in each div.
  6. This was my first use of keyframe animation in CSS. I couldn't decide if I wanted
  the gridlines to show or have a clean blank drawing canvas. I compromised by
  having the grid lines appear briefly when the grid is resized. This was accomplished
  with the keyframe.
